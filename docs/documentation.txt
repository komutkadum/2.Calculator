- used math.js for calculating expression 
- for the input to be right to left, used a simple text align in css. At first was using the attribute 'dir' in input tag but wasn't good for operators so ignored the idea.
=when the input is zero, cleared the whole text in the input so as not to come as zero at the beginning of the numbers.
- used google fonts robota for better font.
- the color combination is a little on the blue and dark side as suited.
